# Mock Reddit Client

## Description
This project was part of my Codecademy Frontend Career Path certification. It was my first time using the Redux library to keep track of the state in a web application. While the syntax was difficult at first, I found that Redux helped me create a better organized application using the store and action thunks.

## Features
In this project, you can select a subreddit and then view previews of some of the current top posts of the subreddit. You can click to expand the preview to view comments and an image if one is included. You can also upvote or downvote posts, however this doesn't have an effect on the actual post. Finally, you can use the search bar to filter the current posts based on their title.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux

## Future Work
Implement a Go Home button if a user searches and recieves no results.
