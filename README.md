# Mock Reddit Client

## Description
This project was part of my Codecademy Frontend Career Path certification. It was my first time using the Redux library to keep track of the state in a web application. While the syntax was difficult at first, I found that Redux helped me create a better organized application using the store and action thunks.

## Features
In this project, you can select a subreddit and then view some of the current top posts of the subreddit. You can also view the comments of each post and upvote or downvote the post (although this does not have an effect on the actual post). Finally, you can use the search bar to filter the current posts based on their title.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Netlify

### Design
The layout and UI/UX design of this app was taken from the example provided by the Codecademy team in their learning module "Portfolio Project: Reddit Client". The design is not my own.

## Future Work
Implement a Go Home button if a user searches and recieves no results.
